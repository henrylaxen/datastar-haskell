        When you click on the "Feed with morph button,
        <br/>There is an empty div below whose text will be replaced
        <br/>with the current time 10 times
        <br/>after that we will sleep for 70 seconds, during which time
        <br/>the pings will continue so we don't time out. Then we will again
        <br/>replace the div with the current time 10 times. After that this
        <br/>text will be removed with a RemoveFragments command
        <br/>after a "settleDuration" of 5 seconds

        When you click the John Keats button, his beautiful
        <i>Ode to a Nightingale</i>
        <br/>Will be slowly printed below, as if someone were typing it
        <br/>on a keyboard.  I am using a &lt;pre&gt; tag, and because I couldn't
        <br/>figure out how to display leading spaces, I prefixed each
        <br/>line with a period.  An <i>engineering</i> solution, not a
        <i>mathematical</i> one.
